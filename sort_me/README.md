In this Module, I have created several methods for different type of Sorting Methods.

To use those methods, firstly import the module to use those methods.

from sort_me import sort  # Using this line of code, sort class will be imported to your program.

Now, coder can use sorting methods by just calling their names.

For Example : 

        sort.bubble(list) #passing a list will return a sorted list sorted by bubble sorting algorithm
        sort.merge(list) #passing a list will return a sorted list sorted by merge sorting algorithm
        sort.quick(list) #passing a list will return a sorted list sorted by quick sorting algorithm
        sort.selection(list) #passing a list will return a sorted list sorted by selection sorting algorithm
        sort.insertion(list) #passing a list will return a sorted list sorted by insertion sorting algorithm

THANK YOU
